<h1 align="center">Image-Steganography-using-Genetic-Algorithm üé≠</h1>

> Steganography is knowledge and art of hiding secret data into information which is largely used in information security systems. The purpose of a steganography algorithm is hiding a large amount of secret data into a meaningful host media such that the embedded secret data are concealed to prevent the attack of unauthorized persons. 

## Idea 
 The main idea of this technique is modeling the steganography problem as a search and optimization problem. 
 In this project a novel image steganography method is imlpemented using Genetic Algorithm with high embedding capacity and obtained results are satisfactory from the aspect of PSNR and capacity.


## Python Libraries 

```sh
OpenCv, numpy, Pillow, math, copy, random
```
