> Steganography is knowledge and art of hiding secret data into information which is largely used in information security systems. The purpose of a steganography algorithm is hiding a large amount of secret data into a meaningful host media such that the embedded secret data are concealed to prevent the attack of unauthorized persons. *The cover or host image* is referred as the original image without the embedded secret message, while the image that is obtained by embedding secret message into cover image without destroying the cover image is termed as *stego image*.

## Idea 
 The main idea of this technique is modeling the steganography problem as a search and optimization problem. Genetic Algorithm is used here to find the best place for embedding modified secret data in host image to achieve high level of security and maximized PSNR(peak-signal to noise ratio) of stego image.
- In this project a novel image steganography method is imlpemented using Genetic Algorithm with high embedding capacity and obtained results are satisfactory from the aspect of PSNR and capacity. Given below are some different scanning starting points in differnet directions.
