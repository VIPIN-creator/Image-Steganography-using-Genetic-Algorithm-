<h1 align="center">Image-Steganography-using-Genetic-Algorithm 🎭</h1>

> In this project a novel image steganography method is imlpemented using Genetic Algorithm with high embedding capacity and obtained results are satisfactory from the aspect of PSNR and capacity.

## Idea 
 The main idea of this technique is modeling the steganography problem as a search and optimization problem.


## Python Libraries 

```sh
OpenCv, numpy, Pillow, math, copy, random
```
